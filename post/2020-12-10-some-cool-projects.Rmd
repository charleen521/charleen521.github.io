One of the classes that I really enjoyed here at UT was CS324E which is Elements of Graphics and Visualization. We created a lot of cool graphics and animations projects and even made games. 

This first one was my final project and definitely my favorite. We made a game from start to finish to catch all of Santa's Lost Presents! The demo video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/kXNU-pjiayc) or below.
