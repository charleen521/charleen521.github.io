      <description>Hello! I am currently a senior here at the University of Texas at Austin and plan to graduate in May 2021. I am originally from Dallas, TX and moved to Austin for school. After my years at UT, I hope to go into the medical field but for now I currently enjoy the jobs I have including teaching as a undergraduate TA and tutor and working with a doctor as a clinical assistant.</description>
