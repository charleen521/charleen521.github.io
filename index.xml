      <description>Hello! I am currently a senior here at the University of Texas at Austin and plan to graduate in May 2021. I am originally from Dallas, TX and moved to Austin for school. After my years at UT, I hope to go into the medical field but for now I currently enjoy the jobs I have including teaching as a undergraduate TA and tutor and working with a doctor as a clinical assistant.</description>

      <description>CHARLEEN TA (ct28558)  Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 10/11/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).
The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
