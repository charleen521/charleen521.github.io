One of the classes that I really enjoyed here at UT was CS324E which is Elements of Graphics and Visualization. We created a lot of cool graphics and animations projects and even made games. 

This first one was my final project and definitely my favorite. We made a game to catch all of Santa's Lost Presents!

Some other examples include a physics-based animation which can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/106DSL0I9cQ) and a very basic animation which can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/IVF-gER-MUU).
