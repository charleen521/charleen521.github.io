Hello! I am currently a senior here at the University of Texas at Austin and plan to graduate in May 2021. I am 
originally from Dallas, TX and moved to Austin for school. After my years at UT, I hope to go into the medical field
but for now I currently enjoy the jobs I have including teaching as a undergraduate TA and tutor and working with a
doctor as a clinical assistant. Some hobbies of mine include traveling, cooking, and finding the best local food spots but of course I also love Netflix binges. Below are just some pictures from my last trip to Greece.
